Clone the repository from <github at http://www.github.com/deepfryed/dbicpp> and have fun!

Installing:

Read the instructions on <github at http://github.com/deepfryed/dbicpp/blob/master/README.rdoc>.

Reading:

At the very least you need to know how <AbstractHandle>, <AbstractStatement>, <Handle>,
and <Statement> work. It is also recommended that you read through documentation on <Param>.

Examples:

Checkout <Handle>, <StringIO> or <Reactor> for some quick examples. dbic++ source distribution
also contains some examples that can be found under src/examples/.

To compile code that uses dbic++, use pkg-config to get the correct compiler flags.

(begin code)
g++ `pkg-config --libs --cflags dbic++` -o myprogram myprogram.cc
(end)

Benchmarks:

You can run these yourself if you're keen. The makefile might need some tweaks
on non-debian based distributions. The following results were obtained on a
Core2DUO 2.53GHz, 4GB, 5200rpm drive with stock database configs.

* The dataset size is 50 rows of 3 fields (id, text, timestamp)
* 10000 SELECT queries run back to back, fetching all rows and printing them.

(begin code)
cd bench/ && make

./benchmarks.sh

+ Setting up sample data (50 rows)
  * mysql
  * postgresql
+ Done

./benchmarks.sh -w bench -n10000
